# Mini-Project_Seabooks

Seabooks is a book management library inspired by the theme of the sea. It provides a simple interface to organize and keep track of your books across three shelves: Want to Read, Currently Reading, and Finished Reading.

## Features

- Add books to the corresponding shelves: Want to Read, Currently Reading, or Finished Reading.
- Track your progress and keep a record of the books you have read.

## Usage
Seabooks provides a user-friendly interface to manage your book collection. Once you have integrated Seabooks into your project, you can perform the following actions:

- Add Books: Click on the "Add Book" button in each shelf (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Finished Reading) to add a new book. Enter the book's details such as title, author, date of publication, genre, and cover image. The book will be added to the corresponding shelf.
- Track Progress: By organizing books into different shelves, Seabooks helps you keep track of your reading progress. Move books across shelves as you start, continue, or finish reading them.
